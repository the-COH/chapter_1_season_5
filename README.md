# NFTs2Me - Empowering NFT creators on Canto
Our goal is to make the process of creating, deploying, and managing your NFT collections as simple as possible, while providing advanced and unique features.


## What is NFTs2Me?
**[NFTs2Me](https://nfts2me.com/)** is a user-friendly comprehensive platform to create, deploy and manage your NFT collection and community, **100% free** with advanced functionalities. It embraces the three big pillars of the NFT life cycle: creation, deployment, and administration of the contract and the community, empowering NFT creators.

The **creation** pillar allows users to create their own NFTs artwork using a simple and user-friendly interface. Users can upload their own artwork or other digital assets or use our builtin generative art tool, and we'll guide them through the process of creating the metadata, defining its rarity, and uploading the collection to IPFS (a decentralized immutable file system) for free.

The **deployment** pillar allows users to create and deploy the NFT contract on the blockchain, making them immutable, verified and accessible to the public. Our optimized system offers ultra low contract deployment fees while keeping advanced functionalities, like different minting types, minting the NFTs on any ERC-20 (like NOTE, WCANTO or ATOM) or native coin (CANTO), Soulbound tokens, on chain affiliation... Furthermore, we offer the possibility to use our upgradeable contracts to benefit from new upcoming features. When deploying a collection you'll receive an NFT that represents its ownership.

The **administration** pillar focuses on the management of collection including the community aspect of the life cycle. Create custom subdomains or minting widgets for your own website, allowlists, whitelists, airdrops, set the drop and end date, create token gated content only accessible for your owners.

Let's talk about some of this fantastic features that make NFTs2Me different.

## What makes NFTs2Me different?
### Anypayments & ERC-20 mintings
NFTs2Me allows to set the minting price not only in native, but also in any currency/ERC-20, and let the users mint in any-currency/native coin. Set a price in Native Coin (e.g. CANTO) or ERC-20 ($NOTE, USDC, USDT, ATOM...). Let your users **mint your NFTs with anything** (Native or any ERC-20). We do a **transparent swap and mint** for the user in one transaction. The owner always receives in the defined payment.

### Collections as NFTs (Ownership)
When a new collection is deployed on the Blockchain, the owner will receive an NFT indicating its ownership of the deployed collection. The owner of the NFT will be the **owner of the collection**. Therefore, if you'd like to transfer the ownership of the collection, you'd just have to transfer the NFT to the new owner.

> The collection ownership is determined by an NFT we mint for you once you mint the collection. To transfer the ownership of the collection is as simple as transferring your ownership NFT.

When selling your collection you are selling the ownership as well as the owner's revenue (including secondary sales). **Just think about it and how powerful this is!**. The user is free to keep it or sell it (for instance, on OpenSea).

### Different minting types
**Sequential**, **Random** or **Specify minting** allow you to choose the minting behaviour on your collection. Over that, you can use a **Placeholder** to hide the actual metadata until you decide to reveal and fix on the blockchain.  

> Minting Types are compatible with Placeholder. For instance, you can use Sequential Minting along with Placeholder to temporarily hide the metadata, and reveal at a later time.

-   **SEQUENTIAL MINTING**. It describe itself. 
-   **SPECIFY MINTING**. Let your users decide their tokens.
-  **RANDOM MINTING**. Truly on-chain two-steps secure random minting.


### On-chain affiliation

Our on-chain affiliate system allows to reward both affiliates who help you sell the collection, as well as offer an optional discount for the end user coming from a affiliate link.

The **optional discount** is a great way to help promote your collection through affiliates, as these ensure that their audience will want to use their reference.

> You can choose to set a **general affiliation information** (commission and user discount), but you can also set a different and **custom per wallet affiliation information** (commission and user discount). That way, you can provide special commission conditions for top affiliates.

### Token Gating

Token gating is **a common tool used by NFT project teams to create value for community members**. Essentially, token gating allows projects to reward people who hold their NFTs by creating exclusive content, events, and other benefits available only to token holders.
Using our tools you'll be able to natively let your users (owner of NFTs from your collection) access exclusive content, exclusive Airdrops, ...


### Custom minting pages with free subdomain
Set up a **custom mint page** with your own subdomain to mint your NFTs or embed it in your website easily using our widget. You'll be able to set your own **custom subdomain** hosted by us or use you own website/domain.

### And much more!

Free IPFS-hosting, soulbound tokens, NFT holder snapshots, automatic logo and banner generation, split revenue, PSD support, airdrops with CSV batch sending, whitelisting, decentralized Governance and on-chain voting support, very gas efficient deployments...


## NFTs2Me ❤️ Canto

At NFTs2Me we leverages on Canto's Free Public Infrastructure and CSR to make it native to the Canto's culture.

### Contract Secured Revenue (CSR) for the creators
When creating an NFT collection, the collection contract registers on the CSR Turnstile to generate an NFT for the collection owner. Instead of keeping for us, 100% of the accrued revenue with go to the owner. That's a great way to, for instance, earn revenue with free minting NFT collections ([link](https://nfts2me.com/blog/how-to-earn-revenue-with-free-minting-collections-on-canto-with-csr/)).

### Native $NOTE support
Giving the users the ability to create collections using $NOTE or any ERC-20 (WCANTO, ATOM, ETH, USDC...) instead of just native Coin (CANTO) gives the user a powerful tool to manage their risks. 
Not all NFT all born the same way. Some utility NFTs must have a fixed price that doesn't fluctuate as native coins usually do. Setting the minting price in $NOTE will give them a powerful tool.

### Seamless Canto DEX integration
Integrating Canto DEX we allow the users to pay on native coin even if the collection minting price is set on an ERC-20 like the $NOTE stablecoin. We've done that leveraging the Canto's DEX in a seamless and transparent way for the user. In just one transaction the user is able to mint paying with Native (CANTO) regardless of what the minting coin is. For instance, that way the creator receives everything in $NOTE stablecoin while allowing the users to use Native Coin (Canto).

## The future of NFTs2Me

During the Hackathon we've deployed our tool on Canto's mainnet, so it can now be used to deploy NFTs projects on Canto's blockchain. [LAUNCH TWEET](https://twitter.com/nfts2me/status/1625823610442055680)

We've also received several improvement requests from the Canto community during the Hackathon and we have implemented some of them:
* Being able to add animated art (e.g. GIFs) as layers for NFT generation. [TWEET](https://twitter.com/nfts2me/status/1624850827314868225)
* Being able to indicate the maximum number of tokens that a wallet can mint (Max Per Wallet).
* Being able to indicate the drop and end date of the collection. [TWEET](https://twitter.com/nfts2me/status/1626555336936095744)
  
We're thrilled to continue listening to the community and making it easier to create, deploy, and manage NFT projects. We'll continue to implement new features as requested.

If we win the hackathon, we plan to **re-invest a big chunk of the prize** to promote the **growth** and creation of NFT utility collections within the **Canto ecosystem** through:

* Competitions
* Direct rewards
* Raffles among creators
* Giving away our utility token (Booster Pack)
 
We want to continue building the most complete NFT toolkit for creators in the blockchain market.
