## **Introduction**

This document embodies and showcases our  conception of a revolutionary dapp for the Canto ecosystem. It provides a comprehensive overview of our ambitious long-term vision, along with a clear roadmap outlining our MVP strategy and its successive phases, aimed at realizing our vision in its entirety.

## **Background**

Canto represents a pioneering addition to the Layer 1 arena, possessing distinctive features that provide previously unachievable use cases within the web3 ecosystem. The platform fosters the development of public goods, such as fundamental infrastructure and services, essential to the creation of a superior and streamlined environment for users. The cornerstone of Canto's innovation lies not in its technical innovations but rather in its socioeconomic principles. The ecosystem is rooted in a distinctive ideology centered on the notion of public goods, offering a unique perspective that distinguishes it from other blockchain platforms. This ideological foundation enables developers to conceive dapps that promote growth and prosperity for both the project and the community at large.

## **Problem Definition / User Needs**

The Canto ecosystem is in its nascent stage, and it is currently navigating its position within the web3 landscape. Despite its promising potential, the development of dapps and necessary infrastructure remains an ongoing process, rendering the available offerings for users limited. Consequently, users are yet to fully experience the richness of a mature DeFi environment and the diverse suite of tools that it offers.

This presents a rare opportunity to not only offer a novel and inventive decentralized application to users but also to become a crucial cornerstone of the Canto ecosystem, playing a pivotal role in its future development. As Penny provides seamless and expansive access to the Canto ecosystem, both Penny and Canto will thrive, and users will be richly rewarded for their involvement. This mutually beneficial relationship will drive growth and foster a thriving DeFi community, as users are incentivized to engage and contribute to Penny and the ecosystem.

💡 **This is where Penny comes in: Penny serves as your one-stop shop for all DeFi-related needs within the Canto ecosystem. With Penny, you can effortlessly monitor your portfolio, encompassing both tokens and NFTs. Easily swap tokens or sweep NFTs with ease. Additionally, Penny provides an array of tools that grant you access to the latest NFT mints, in-depth on-chain analytics, and the most favorable price for your token swaps. However, Penny's key differentiating factor is its utilization of Contract Secure Revenue (CSR), fractionalizing it and dedicating a portion of the revenue to the wider community, making it a unique and community-driven platform.**

</aside>

Another obstacle that persists in the web3 space is the user experience and user interface. Recognizing this challenge, Penny is committed to making substantial investments toward crafting a UI that is intuitive and effortless to navigate while simultaneously delivering unparalleled value and unlocking the full potential of decentralized finance. Our aim is to bridge the gap between technology and ease of use, making it possible for users to fully embrace the possibilities of web3 and participate in Canto’s DeFi ecosystem with confidence and convenience.
