# Drone DAO

Ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of solution for detecting & managing UAVs & Drones using modular iot gateway device solution, Canto blockchain, IBC and Cosmos, setting up geo fences using predictive analytics, expert.ai nlp apis, automation, Ethereum & Filecoin eco-system tools.

Platform Features:

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports.

# Canto, IBC and Cosmos Eco-system

1. Canto enables us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees. That is very important both from the privacy and cost effectiveness front.

2. Cosmos interoperability with Ethereum like blockchains. Also, ability to use decentralize NFT voting for incident investigative system.

3. Ability to generate NFT and ease of identity management.

4. We are generating an NFT for NFC tags for drones and UAVs and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows.

5. Identity management, ability to extend the solution using IBC and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting are the key reasons for experimenting with Canto.


Overall, Canto enables investigative case management and incident reporting, identity management at the time of allocation of a case to a police officer, incident severity analysis based on the decentralize voting at the IBC chain.
