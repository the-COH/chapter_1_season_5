## Introduction: 

HappyArts is a service where artists create digital art, and we curate and mint them using our smart contracts. 

We offer tools and resources to help artists better understand and utilize blockchain and decentralized platforms, and promote the integration of these technologies within the arts community.

We empower local artists and help them reach new audiences and achieve greater success by providing a comprehensive and supportive platform for them to showcase their work, connect with fans and customers, and grow their careers using the latest web3 technologies.



## Vision:

Create a thriving online community for local artists where they can share, sell, and promote their work using the latest web3 technologies. 



## Mission:

To provide a comprehensive and supportive platform for local artists to showcase their work, connect with fans and customers, and grow their careers using the latest web3 technologies.



## Long-time success plan:

We have several strategies to ensure the project's long-term success, including collaboration with stakeholders, user-centered design, robust technology, and a sustainable revenue model. By working closely with artists and other stakeholders, we can understand their needs and deliver a positive experience. We prioritize user experience when developing the project, making it as intuitive and accessible as possible for our targeted user profile of local artists with limited or no Web3 knowledge. We ensure that the technology behind the project is robust and scalable to accommodate future growth and meet artists’ needs.



## User Experience:

The HappyArts User Experience Project's sustainability plan in Web3 involves several strategies to ensure the project’s long-term success. These strategies include:

Collaboration with stakeholders: HappyArts works closely with artists and other stakeholders to understand their needs and ensure that the project delivers a positive experience.

User-centred design: HappyArts prioritizes user experience when developing the project, making it as intuitive and accessible as possible for its targeted user profile (local artists with limited or no Web3 knowledge).

Robust technology: HappyArts ensures that the technology behind the project is robust and scalable to accommodate future growth and meet artists’ needs.

Sustainable revenue model: HappyArts will take advantage of Canto’s CSR, establishing a sustainable revenue model that supports the ongoing maintenance and development of the project, such as advertising artists’ works and engaging with Canto’s community.

The HappyArts User Experience (UX) Project will present itself as intuitive and understandable for its targeted user profile by using clear and simple language, engaging visuals, and user-friendly design. It will be designed to minimize user frustration and maximize ease of use. We are taking into consideration some existing Web3 examples (without mirroring or copying them) to mimic a similar already successful experience to the art community (i.e. SuperRare and Foundation)
