## CANTORA

CANTORA is a cutting-edge liquidity service protocol that leverages the Canton swap and lending infrastructure to enhance the capital utilization efficiency for users who stake Canto. Moreover, using the NFT Marketplace improves flexibility and liquidity during the 21-day unstaking lock period. By providing this service, we can significantly enhance the user experience, foster active trading in the Canto swap and lending infrastructure, and attract more users and opportunities to the Canto NFT Marketplace.

**(Note: While the Canto NFT Marketplace may not yet be ready now, this functionality will be implemented after the marketplace has been successfully launched.)**
