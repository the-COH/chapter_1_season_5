# Frenly Faces Discord Verification Bot

This is a combination frontend / backend, released under MIT license, that allows projects to NFT gate a discord role and configure secret channels and other things for thier holders in Discord chat. This was created for the hackatthon and is already in production use in both my own community, Frenly Faces, as well as the Shnoises discord server which I have assisted with setting that up for them. Cheers!
