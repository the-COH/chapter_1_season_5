# The Dumping Bandits

A game by [Tendeeno](https://twitter.com/Tendeeno_) and [Strobie](https://twitter.com/0xstrobe).

## Description

The first decentralized, public goods casino. Dumping Bandits is the first game, which takes a % of winnings and adds it to the house pot. That pot acts as the counterparty for future games, with none of the money coming out of the pot for anything other than paying out winners. The more people play, the bigger the pot gets, the bigger people can bet (and win!)
